# Real Haitians Unite

Welcome to my Savage Demo APP! I a theme related to my birth country (Haiti) to add some originality and pride. Here, users can add a message, then give it a thumbs up, thumbs down, or delete it. I like the theme of Haitians having a platform to connect with each other and ask for advice.

# How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MongoDB. I especially enjoyed incorporating the node_modules in this project so that it could work server site in addition to client side. The original version did not have a functional thumbs down button, but I fixed the issue by modifying the CRUD API and making necessary changes in my other files connected to the server. I also added a log in / sign up feature.



# Lessons Learned:
I learned that when running files server-side it's important to kill the server and rerun node server.js in the command line every time. I learned how to read through error messages to debug with more confidence and understanding.

Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
